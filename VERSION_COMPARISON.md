## 🔧 **If You Still Want the Full Version (Not Recommended)**

### **Installation Steps (High Risk of Issues):**

```bash
# Step 1: Clean existing PyTorch
pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio -y
pip cache purge

# Step 2: Install PyTorch CPU version
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# Step 3: Install Sentence Transformers (large download ~1-2GB)
pip install sentence-transformers

# Step 4: Install spaCy with models
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# Step 5: Optional - LangExtract
pip install langextract
```

### **Potential Issues:**
- CUDA library conflicts (you already experienced this)
- Large model downloads (1-4GB)
- Memory requirements (2-4GB RAM minimum)
- Complex dependency chains
- Windows compatibility issues

## 📈 **Accuracy Comparison for PLO-MLO Analysis**

### **PyTorch-Free Version Results:**
- **Keyword Matching Accuracy**: 90%+ (educational terms are well-defined)
- **Bloom's Classification**: 85%+ (rule-based works excellently for academic text)
