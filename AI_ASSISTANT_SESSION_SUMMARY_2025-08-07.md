# PLO-MLO Alignment Matrix: Refactor and Color Coding Summary (as of 2025-08-07)

## What We Have Talked About and Tried

### 1. Color Scheme and Score Classes
- Discussed and clarified the standardized pastel color scheme for score classes in `shared.css`:
  - `--score-poor`, `--score-weak`, `--score-moderate`, `--score-good`, `--score-excellent`.
- Identified and removed obsolete/extra score classes (e.g., `.score-1` to `.score-5`, `.score-very-strong`, etc.) from `clo-mlo.html`.
- Confirmed that only the new color classes should be used for all alignment matrix and breakdown tables.

### 2. Matrix and Detailed Breakdown Rendering
- Diagnosed that the matrix and detailed breakdown tables were not applying the correct color classes.
- Proposed and attempted to implement a universal `getScoreClass` utility and update rendering logic to use it for consistent coloring and formatting.
- Encountered issues with code changes, including syntax errors and rendering bugs.
- Reverted `plo-mlo.html` to the last known good version to restore stability.

### 3. Debugging and Error Handling
- Investigated and fixed a console error caused by a duplicate/broken code block after `renderPLOView`.
- Ensured that the file is now syntactically correct and stable.

### 4. Manual and Automated Edits
- Noted that the user made some manual edits after the last automated changes.
- Confirmed that the current file reflects the user's latest manual state.

## What Is Remaining To Be Done

1. **Universal Score Class Utility**
   - If desired, re-introduce a universal `getScoreClass` and `formatScore` utility (in a shared JS file) for consistent score-to-class mapping and formatting.
   - Carefully update all relevant rendering logic (matrix, detailed breakdown, etc.) to use this utility, ensuring no syntax or runtime errors.

2. **Consistent Application of Color Classes**
   - Double-check that all score cells in the matrix and breakdown tables use the correct class (e.g., `score-poor`, `score-weak`, etc.) and not raw numeric classes.
   - Ensure that the color scheme matches the variables defined in `shared.css`.

3. **Code Cleanup and Refactoring**
   - Remove any remaining obsolete or duplicate code related to old score classes or color logic.
   - Ensure that all HTML/JS is clean, maintainable, and free of dead code.

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test the UI thoroughly to confirm that all score colorings and formatting are correct in all views (matrix, PLO, MLO, etc.).
   - Check for any remaining console errors or warnings.

5. **Documentation**
   - Optionally, document the color coding logic and utility usage for future maintainers.

---

**Current Status:**
- The project is stable and reverted to a working state.
- Color coding is visually correct as per the last user edits.
- No critical errors remain, but further refactoring and utility improvements are possible if desired.

**Next Steps:**
- Resume work by carefully re-applying utility-based refactoring if needed, or continue with other improvements as planned.
