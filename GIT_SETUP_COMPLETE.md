# 🛠️ Git Setup for VS Code Terminal

## ✅ Problem Solved!

Git is now working in your VS Code terminal! Here's what was set up:

### 🔧 What Was Done:

1. **Created PowerShell Profile**: `$PROFILE` location
2. **Added Git to PATH**: Git commands now work in PowerShell
3. **Verified Installation**: Git version 2.43.0.windows.1 confirmed

### 📝 PowerShell Profile Location:
```
\\intra.ttu.ee\home\siyi.ma\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
```

### 🎯 Git Commands Now Available:

```bash
# Basic Git commands now work directly in VS Code terminal:
git status
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push origin main
git pull
git branch
git log
```

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy to GitHub Pages!

Now you can push your GitHub Pages deployment:

```bash
# Add all the new deployment files
git add .

# Commit the deployment configuration
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment configuration"

# Push to trigger auto-deployment
git push origin main
```

## 🎯 Current Repository Status:

From `git status`, these files are ready to be committed:
- ✅ `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (GitHub Actions)
- ✅ `404.html` (Custom error page)
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` (Setup guide)
- ✅ `GITHUB_PAGES_DEPLOYMENT.md` (Deployment documentation)
- ✅ `README.md` (Updated with deployment info)

## 🔄 How This Works:

### Automatic Loading
- PowerShell profile loads automatically when you open VS Code terminal
- Git PATH is added to your session every time
- No admin rights required
- Persists across restarts

### If You Need to Troubleshoot:
```powershell
# Check if profile exists
Test-Path $PROFILE

# Manually reload profile
. $PROFILE

# Verify Git path
$env:PATH -split ';' | Select-String 'Git'
```

## 🎉 Next Steps:

1. **Commit your deployment files** (as shown above)
2. **Enable GitHub Pages** in your repository settings
3. **Access your live site** at: `https://siyi-ma.github.io/maj-iloalignment/`
