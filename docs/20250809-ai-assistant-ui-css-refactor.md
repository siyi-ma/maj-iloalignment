# 20250809-ai-assistant-ui-css-refactor

## Main Theme
UI and CSS refactor for the AI Assistant and PLO-MLO alignment tools, focusing on maintainability, button layout, error handling, and communication best practices.

## Errors Encountered
- CSS lint errors: "at-rule or selector expected" and "{ expected" due to misplaced or unmatched curly braces in the `<style>` block.
- Unintended display of the "Clear Results" and "Copy Result" buttons when no results were present.

## Solutions Implemented
- Moved inline CSS from HTML `<style>` blocks to external CSS files for maintainability.
- Centered the "Analyze with AI" button and reduced its height for better UI appearance.
- Displayed token usage as plain text below the main action button.
- Hid the "Clear Results" button when no results are shown, and hid the "Copy Result" button after analysis.
- Provided explanations for CSS errors and guidance for resolving them.

## Code Snippets
**Linking external CSS:**
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/ai-assistant-styles.css">
```

**Centering and resizing button:**
```html
<div style="width: 100%; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
  <button id="analyze-btn" class="btn btn-primary" style="height: 38px; min-height: 0; padding-top: 6px; padding-bottom: 6px; font-size: 16px;">üöÄ Analyze with AI</button>
</div>
```

**Plain token usage display:**
```html
<div id="token-estimation" style="margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; font-size: 15px; color: #333; background: none; border: none; padding: 0; border-radius: 0; border-left: none;">
  <strong>Estimated Token Usage</strong>
  <div id="token-breakdown">Input tokens: <span id="input-tokens">0</span> | Expected output tokens: <span id="output-tokens">~2000</span> | <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #1976d2;">Total estimated: <span id="total-tokens">~2000</span> tokens</span></div>
</div>
