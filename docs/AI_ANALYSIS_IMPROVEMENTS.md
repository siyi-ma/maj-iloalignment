# âœ… AI Analysis & UI Improvements Complete!

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issues Fixed:**

### 1. **MLO Column Width Issue** âœ…
- **Problem:** MLO code columns were too wide (70px)
- **Solution:** Reduced to 45px with proper constraints
- **Changes:**
  - `.mlo-header` width: 70px â†’ 45px
  - `.score-cell` width: 70px â†’ 45px  
  - Added `min-width` and `max-width` constraints
  - Adjusted padding for better fit

### 2. **Generic AI Analysis Issue** âœ…
- **Problem:** AI suggestions were too generic and unhelpful
- **Solution:** Complete rewrite of analysis engine for context-specific insights

## ðŸ¤– **Enhanced AI Analysis Features:**

### **Context-Aware Suggestions:**
Instead of generic text like "Consider reviewing alignment", now provides:

**ðŸ”´ For Weak Alignment (<2.5):**
- "ðŸŒ± Add sustainability focus: Include environmental assessment, ESG frameworks"
- "ðŸ“Š Add analytical methods: Include specific analysis techniques"
- "ðŸŽ¯ Elevate cognitive level: MLO needs higher-order thinking (ANALYZE)"

**ðŸŸ¡ For Moderate Alignment (2.5-3.5):**
- "ðŸ”— Bridge conceptual gap: Explicitly mention life cycle assessment (LCA)"
- "ðŸ“‹ Add project-based assessment to demonstrate practical application"

**ðŸŸ¢ For Strong Alignment (>4.0):**
- "âœ¨ Excellent keyword overlap - consider adding specific learning outcomes"
- "ðŸŽ¯ Perfect cognitive level match (ANALYZE) - maintain this alignment"

### **Domain-Specific Analysis:**
- **Sustainability Focus:** Recognizes environmental, LCA, circular economy terms
- **Technology Integration:** Identifies digital tools, innovation, practical application
- **Business Context:** Understands management, strategy, economic frameworks
- **Assessment Methods:** Suggests specific evaluation approaches

### **Improved Reasoning:**
Instead of: "Strong semantic similarity between PLO and MLO"
Now provides: "Strong conceptual alignment: shared focus on sustainability, assessment, lifecycle"

### **Enhanced Keyword Detection:**
Added 25+ domain-specific terms:
- Sustainability: `sustainability`, `lifecycle`, `lca`, `circular`, `renewable`
- Assessment: `assessment`, `framework`, `methodology`, `evaluation`
- Technology: `innovation`, `practical`, `tools`, `methods`

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Improvements:**

### **Better Semantic Analysis:**
- Weighted keyword matching with domain relevance
- Context-specific concept extraction
- Multi-domain alignment detection

### **Smarter Bloom's Taxonomy:**
- Specific suggestions for cognitive level mismatches
- Recognition of assessment complexity requirements
- Practical implementation recommendations

### **Real-World Relevance:**
Based on your screenshot content (environmental sustainability MLOs), the AI now:
- Recognizes LCA methodology connections
- Suggests ESG framework integration
- Identifies green technology applications
- Recommends practical sustainability assessments

## ðŸŽ¯ **Results:**

**Before:** "Consider reviewing the alignment - scores suggest weak connection"

**After:** "ðŸ”´ WEAK ALIGNMENT - Major revision needed. ðŸŒ± Add sustainability focus: Include environmental assessment, ESG frameworks, or circular economy concepts. ðŸŽ¯ Elevate cognitive level: MLO needs higher-order thinking (ANALYZE) - add synthesis, evaluation, or creation activities"

The AI analysis is now **context-aware**, **actionable**, and **domain-specific** for your curriculum alignment needs! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸš€ **To Test:**
1. Run `start_server.bat`
2. Open `plo-mlo-alignment.html`
3. Load a programme and click on matrix cells with AI badges
4. See the dramatically improved analysis quality!
