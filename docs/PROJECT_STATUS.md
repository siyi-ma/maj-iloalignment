## 📋 **What You Learned from the Prototype**

### **Algorithmic Sophistication**
Your original 2170-line prototype contained remarkably advanced educational assessment algorithms:

1. **Multi-Dimensional Scoring Framework**
   ```javascript
   overallScore = (
       keywordScore * 0.4 +      // Lexical similarity
       semanticScore * 0.35 +    // Contextual meaning
       bloomScore * 0.25         // Cognitive alignment
   );
   ```

2. **Educational Domain Expertise**
   - 10 competency categories with specialized keyword analysis
   - Bloom's Taxonomy verb classification (6 cognitive levels)
   - Advanced stopword filtering for educational content
   - Context-aware semantic similarity calculation

3. **Professional Interface Design**
   - TalTech CVI-compliant color palette and typography
   - Progressive disclosure for complex workflows
   - Interactive data visualization with hover states
   - Responsive grid systems and accessible design

4. **Sophisticated Text Processing**
   ```javascript
   // Advanced keyword extraction with frequency analysis
   function extractKeywords(text) {
       return text.toLowerCase()
           .replace(/[^\w\s]/g, ' ')
           .split(/\s+/)
           .filter(word => word.length > 3 && !stopWords.has(word))
           .reduce((acc, word) => {
               acc[word] = (acc[word] || 0) + 1;
               return acc;
           }, {});
   }
   ```
