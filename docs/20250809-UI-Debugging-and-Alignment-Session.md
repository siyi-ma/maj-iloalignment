# 20250809-UI-Debugging-and-Alignment-Session

## Main Theme
Modernization and debugging of the AI alignment web app, focusing on sticky navigation, UI/UX improvements, CSS block validation, and CLO data loading.

## Errors Encountered
- Sticky navigation links not highlighting active state.
- Layout and spacing issues in navigation bar.
- Tooltips present in matrix table against requirements.
- Missing CLOs in UI due to incorrect property access or data loading.
- Console errors after manual edits.
- Incomplete CSS selector for `.back` button.

## Solutions Applied
- Added section IDs and improved sticky nav logic for correct active highlighting.
- Adjusted CSS for navigation bar spacing and active state colors.
- Removed tooltips from matrix table as requested.
- Validated and corrected property access for CLOs from `programmes.json` under `cloik`.
- Performed semantic search and error checks to confirm no syntax errors in recent JS/HTML edits.
- Provided starter CSS block for `.back` selector:

```css
.back {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--tt-light-blue), var(--tt-magenta));
    color: var(--tt-white);
    border-radius: 8px;
    padding: 10px 18px;
    font-weight: 600;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(170, 19, 82, 0.15);
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: background 0.3s, box-shadow 0.3s;
}
.back:hover {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--tt-magenta), var(--tt-light-blue));
    box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(170, 19, 82, 0.25);
}
```
