# Score Color Standardization: Errors, Insights, and Takeaways

## Summary of Discussion

This document summarizes the process and lessons learned while standardizing the score color system across the CLO-MLO and PLO-MLO alignment analysis tools. The focus is on repeated errors, technical insights, and actionable takeaways for future development.

---

## Key Issues Encountered

### 1. **Conflicting Color Systems**
- **Problem:** PLO-MLO used a pastel color system via CSS variables, while CLO-MLO used hardcoded bold colors and inline styles.
- **Impact:** Inconsistent user experience and maintainability issues.

### 2. **Patch Application Failures**
- **Problem:** Automated patching failed due to multiple, scattered, and conflicting CSS/JS definitions for score colors in `clo-mlo.html`.
- **Root Cause:**
  - Duplicate class names (e.g., `.score-1`) with different color values in different places.
  - Inline styles and multiple rendering logics for scores.
  - Large file size and repeated code blocks made context matching ambiguous.

### 3. **Legend Component Inconsistency**
- **Problem:** The score legend markup was custom and not using the standardized `.score-legend` component from `shared.css`.
- **Impact:** Visual inconsistency and extra maintenance.

## Insights & Solutions

### 1. **Centralize Color Variables**
- Move all score color variables to `shared.css` for easy updates and consistent branding.
- Use CSS classes (`.score-1` to `.score-5`) for all score cells.

### 2. **Unify Rendering Logic**
- Replace inline styles and color codes with class-based rendering.
- Map score values to class names in JavaScript, not color codes.

### 3. **Standardize Legend Component**
- Use the `.score-legend` component from `shared.css` for all legends.
- Remove custom legend markup and duplicate CSS.

### 4. **Patch in Small Steps**
- When patching large or complex files, break changes into smaller, targeted edits to avoid context errors.
- Remove conflicting code before updating logic.

### 5. **Validate with Visuals**
- Always check the UI after changes to ensure color and legend consistency.
- Use screenshots to confirm results.

## Takeaways for Future Work

- **Centralize shared styles and components early in the project.**
- **Avoid duplicate class names and inline styles.**
- **Refactor legacy code before applying major updates.**
- **Test changes visually and iteratively.**
- **Document standardization decisions for future contributors.**
