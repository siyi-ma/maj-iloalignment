# 20250809-PLO-MLO Navigation Bar Debugging and Git Workflow

## Main Theme
Debugging and refactoring the sticky navigation bar and dynamic secondary navigation links in the PLO-MLO alignment report web app. Ensuring correct visibility, order, and active state of navigation links in both PLO and MLO views. Clarifying git workflow for selective commit and restore.

## Errors Encountered
- Sticky navigation bar not visible after report generation.
- Dynamic secondary navigation links for modules in MLO view were not shown or appeared in reverse order.
- Active state of navigation links not updating correctly when toggling views.
- Confusion about how to commit only changes in `plo-mlo.html` and discard changes in `ai-assistant.html`.

## Solutions Applied
- Ensured navigation bar is always shown after report generation by updating JS logic.
- Refactored dynamic link insertion logic to guarantee correct order for both PLOs and modules:
  - Sorted PLO links numerically (plo1, plo2, ... plo6).
  - Inserted module links in display order for MLO view.
- Fixed active state logic for navigation links to update correctly on view toggle.
- Provided git commands for selective commit and restore:
  - `git add plo-mlo.html`
  - `git commit -m "Fix navigation bar and dynamic links in plo-mlo.html"`
  - `git restore ai-assistant.html`

## Key Code Snippets
```js
// Ensure navigation bar is shown after report generation
function setupStickyNavigation() {
  const navBar = document.querySelector('.analysis-nav');
  if (navBar) navBar.style.display = 'block';
}

// Insert module links in correct order for MLO view
function updateNavigationWithModules(modules) {
  const navList = document.querySelector('.secondary-nav');
  navList.innerHTML = '';
  modules.forEach(module => {
    const link = document.createElement('a');
    link.textContent = module.name;
    link.href = `#${module.id}`;
    navList.appendChild(link);
  });
}

// Git workflow for selective commit
# Stage only plo-mlo.html
$ git add plo-mlo.html
# Commit changes
$ git commit -m "Fix navigation bar and dynamic links in plo-mlo.html"
# Discard changes in ai-assistant.html
$ git restore ai-assistant.html
```

## Command Line Actions
- Staged and committed only `plo-mlo.html` changes.
- Restored `ai-assistant.html` to discard unwanted changes.

## Factual Process Summary
- Session began with user reporting navigation bar visibility issues in the PLO-MLO alignment report web app.
- Agent investigated HTML, CSS, and JS logic, identifying that the navigation bar was hidden by default and not shown after report generation.
- Agent updated JS to always show the navigation bar post-report.
- User requested dynamic secondary navigation links for modules in MLO view, sorted in display order. Agent refactored link insertion logic to ensure correct order and active state.
- Multiple code patches were applied to address user feedback on navigation bar behavior.
- User asked for git workflow to commit only `plo-mlo.html` changes and discard those in `ai-assistant.html`. Agent provided correct git commands.
- All navigation bar and dynamic link issues were resolved; user to verify final behavior.

## Takeaways for New Project Owners
- Always validate dynamic link insertion order and active state logic when toggling views.
- Use explicit git commands to stage, commit, and restore files for selective workflow.
- Document code changes and command line actions for future debugging and onboarding.
