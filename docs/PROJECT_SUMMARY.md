- **Module Organization**: Learning outcomes grouped by academic modules (YL, P1, P2, etc.)

## üöÄ Development Journey & Major Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Early Development)
**What We Did:**
- Created basic HTML structure with programme selection
- Set up JSON data loading system for programme information
- Implemented initial navigation between pages

**Key Learning:** Starting with a solid foundation is crucial. We learned that planning the data structure early saves time later.

### Phase 2: Content Management Revolution 
**What We Did:**
- Transitioned from hardcoded content to dynamic JSON-based system
- Created `programmes.json` with comprehensive programme data
- Implemented URL parameter passing for maintaining context

**Key Learning:** Dynamic content systems are more complex initially but pay huge dividends in maintainability and scalability.

### Phase 3: PLO-MLO Analysis Enhancement
**What We Did:**
- Built professional matrix table layouts
- Implemented module grouping and organization
- Created two-level headers for complex data presentation
- Added realistic alignment scoring with varied values

**Key Learning:** Real-world applications need realistic data. Static or perfectly aligned data doesn't help users understand actual relationships.

### Phase 4: Styling & Brand Integration
**What We Did:**
- Integrated Tallinn University of Technology brand colors
- Implemented consistent styling across all pages
- Added professional visual hierarchy with proper typography
- Created responsive layouts for different screen sizes

**Key Learning:** Consistent branding and professional appearance significantly impact user trust and usability.

### Phase 5: User Experience Optimization
**What We Did:**
- Added language toggle functionality with localStorage persistence
- Implemented view switching between PLO and MLO perspectives
- Created interactive buttons with proper state management
- Added loading states and error handling

**Key Learning:** Small UX details (like remembering user preferences) make applications feel polished and professional.

### Phase 6: Content Personalization
**What We Did:**
- Made alignment summaries programme-specific
- Created distinct content for each programme (TVTB, MAJB, MAKM)
- Implemented dynamic content generation based on programme selection
- Added contextual analysis and recommendations

**Key Learning:** Generic content doesn't serve users well. Personalized, contextual content provides real value.

## üõ† Technical Concepts Learned

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
```javascript
// Data Layer
const programmeData = await fetch('data/programmes.json');

// Presentation Layer  
function displayAlignmentMatrix(data) { ... }

// Business Logic
function calculateAlignmentScores() { ... }
```
**Why Important:** Keeping data, display, and logic separate makes code easier to maintain and debug.

### 2. **Event-Driven Programming**
```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    setupEventListeners();
});
```
**Why Important:** Modern web applications respond to user actions. Understanding events is fundamental to interactive applications.

### 3. **State Management**
```javascript
window.currentProgrammeCode = programmeCode;
localStorage.setItem('selectedLanguage', language);
```
**Why Important:** Applications need to remember user choices and current context across interactions.

### 4. **Modular Functions**
```javascript
function updateAlignmentSummary(programmeCode, programmeName) {
    const summaryData = alignmentSummaries[programmeCode];
    // Update DOM with programme-specific content
}
```
**Why Important:** Breaking functionality into small, focused functions makes code reusable and easier to test.

### 5. **DOM Manipulation**
```javascript
const element = document.getElementById('alignment-summary');
element.innerHTML = dynamicContent;
element.classList.add('active');
```
**Why Important:** Web applications need to update content dynamically without page reloads.

## üìä Data Architecture Insights

### JSON Structure Design
```json
{
  "tvtb": {
    "kavanimetusek": "Estonian Name",
    "kavanimetusik": "English Name", 
    "plos": [...],
    "mlos": [...],
    "courses": [...]
  }
}
```

**Key Insights:**
- **Bilingual Support**: Every text field has Estonian (`...ek`) and English (`...ik`) versions
- **Nested Organization**: Data grouped by programme, then by type (PLOs, MLOs, courses)
- **Consistent Naming**: Following institutional conventions for field names

### Module Code System
```
yl_mlo1  ‚Üí YL (General Studies) Module, MLO #1
p1_mlo2  ‚Üí P1 (Core Studies) Module, MLO #2
```

**Why Important:** Systematic naming conventions enable automatic categorization and organization.

## üé® Design Principles Applied

### 1. **Visual Hierarchy**
- **H1**: Page titles with icons
- **H2**: Section headers with consistent styling  
- **H3**: Subsection headers
- **Tables**: Clear column headers and alternating row colors

### 2. **Color Psychology**
- **MAGENTA**: Active states, calls-to-action (energy, action)
- **DARK BLUE**: Headers, structure (trust, stability)
- **Grays**: Supporting text (neutrality, balance)

### 3. **Responsive Design**
```css
.programme-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
    gap: 20px;
}
```
**Result:** Layout adapts automatically to screen size without media queries.

## üîß Problem-Solving Patterns

### 1. **The Debugging Process**
When something doesn't work:
1. **Check Browser Console** for error messages
2. **Verify Data Flow** - is data loading correctly?
3. **Test Element Selection** - do DOM elements exist?
4. **Validate Function Calls** - are functions being called with correct parameters?

### 2. **Git Merge Conflict Resolution**
When merging branches:
1. **Identify conflict markers** (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
2. **Choose which version to keep** (HEAD vs incoming)
3. **Remove conflict markers** completely
4. **Test functionality** after resolution

### 3. **Content Not Updating Issues**
Common pattern we solved multiple times:
1. **Check URL parameters** - are they being passed correctly?
2. **Verify function calls** - is the update function being called?
3. **Confirm data availability** - is the required data loaded?
4. **Test DOM manipulation** - are elements being updated?

## üí° Key Insights for New Developers

### 1. **Start Simple, Build Incrementally**
We didn't build the complex matrix tables first. We started with basic programme selection and gradually added features. Each working version gave us confidence to add the next feature.

### 2. **Real Data Changes Everything**
Working with actual programme data revealed challenges we didn't anticipate with dummy data:
- Different programmes have different numbers of PLOs/MLOs
- Text content varies greatly in length
- Some data fields might be missing

### 3. **User Experience Details Matter**
Small touches made big differences:
- Remembering language preferences
- Showing loading states
- Providing clear navigation
- Using consistent styling

### 4. **Version Control is Essential**
Git branches allowed us to:
- Experiment with new features safely
- Revert changes when something broke
- Collaborate without conflicts
- Track what changed when

### 5. **Documentation Saves Time**
Clear variable names, consistent patterns, and good comments helped us:
- Remember what code does weeks later
- Debug issues faster
- Add new features more easily
