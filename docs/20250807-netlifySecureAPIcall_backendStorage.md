# Conversation Summary â€“ 2025-08-07

## Key Topics and Progress

- **Secure Gemini API Integration:**
  - Guided setup of a Netlify Function as a secure proxy for Gemini 1.5 Flash API, ensuring API keys are never exposed in frontend code.
  - Helped resolve Netlify deployment issues (invalid filenames, secret scanning, environment variables).
  - Assisted in updating frontend code to use the Netlify proxy endpoint and remove all hardcoded API keys.
  - Diagnosed and resolved API errors (expired key, 400/503 errors, quota issues).

- **Netlify Secret Scanning:**
  - Explained and created `SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_PATHS` to exclude the `docs` and other folders from secret scanning.
  - Provided instructions for adding more folders to the omit list.

- **Netlify Deploy Troubleshooting:**
  - Clarified the difference between "Retry with latest branch commit" and "Retry without cache" options.

- **AI Assistant and Analysis Features:**
  - Enhanced token usage tracking and quota display for Gemini API usage.
  - Improved error handling for overloaded model (503) and quota warnings.
  - Added real-time statistics for token usage, quota, and reset time.
  - Guided on best practices for collecting and storing user feedback (suggested backend/database or Netlify Function).

- **CLO-MLO and PLO-MLO Analysis Improvements:**
  - Matched CLO-MLO analysis UI and logic to advanced PLO-MLO methodology (floating TOC, keyword highlighting, competency tags, improved scoring, and suggestions).
  - Fixed issues with justification, improvement suggestions, and table layout.
  - Improved PDF export to use correct course fields and table proportions.
  - Added user input for study programme name, study level, and improved MLO/CLO input UX.

## Backend Storage of User Feedbacks

We discussed best practices for collecting and storing user feedback on AI-generated reports. The recommended approach is to use a secure backend solution, such as:

- A custom backend API (Node.js, Python, etc.) with a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Netlify Functions as API endpoints, storing feedback in a service like Airtable, Google Sheets, or a database
- For simple setups, using email or Google Forms to collect feedback

This ensures feedback is stored securely, is persistent, and can be easily retrieved for analysis or improvement of the system. Implementation guidance is available for any of these options as needed.

## Outcomes
- Secure, user-friendly AI assistant and analysis tools are now working and deployed.
- All code and deployment best practices are followed (no API keys in frontend, secure proxy, clear error handling).
- Token usage and quota are visible to users, with proactive warnings.
- Feedback collection is ready for backend integration.
- All requested UI/UX and analysis improvements for CLO-MLO and PLO-MLO are implemented.
